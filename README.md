# LoginEnterprise

This repository contains useful scripts and code that can be used with Login Enterprise's API. 

## Scripts

This folder contains ad hoc scripts created based on real customer scenarios. There is a README with more specific information in the directory. There are also example resources that can be referenced when creating input artifacts (e.g. .csv with accounts to update passwords for). 

## publicApi

Through ad hoc scripting and otherwise, a collection of Powershell functions for specific API endpoint was formed. Here is where that work lives. Not every endpoint is covered, and there is no robust error handling. Ye be warned...

### Disclaimers

This repository is maintained on a best effort basis. There is no guarantee that these scripts will work in your enviroment as-is.

#### Last Update

As of 2/23/2024, the scripts use the current production version of Login Enterprise Public API, which is v6.
